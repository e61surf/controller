# control
Feel free to make use of the hardware and software designs here for your project. The board design utilizes:
3 ST Micro motor drivers,
1 Lynx GPS Module, and
1 Microchip BLE Module

It is designed to fit into a Cinch ModeICE enclosure.

The hardware/software design supports up to a 10 wire, 5 volt control cable with 2 potentiometers, 3 momentary switches, and 3 LED indicators

The board is designed to run on 12v power from a marine or automotive alternator, so it'll handle fluctuations and noise.

The BLE module and supporting AVR code supports a custom framed serial protocol for control via a mobile app.  See the documents for more info.
